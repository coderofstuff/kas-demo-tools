# Kas Demo Tools

A bunch of random scripts to demonstrate some functionality of the WASM SDK.

This should not be used for production environments.

## Dependency
- Requires Kaspa WASM SDK
  - Download from releases: https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/releases
  - Build from source by following: https://aspectron.org/en/projects/kaspa-wasm.html

Place the SDK in the root of this directory as `kaspa`

Code here will require this SDK via

```
const kaspa = require('./kaspa/kaspa');
```
